# AI Agent Engineer Course

Welcome to the **AI Agent Engineer Course**, your comprehensive, community-driven guide to mastering the design, development, and deployment of intelligent AI agents. Whether you're software developer transitioning into AI, an ML engineer aiming to build autonomous workflows, or an aspiring architect orchestrating multi-agent systems, this course will equip you with the skills, projects, and leadership mindset to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving field.

## Why This Course Exists

### Future-Proof Your Career

AI agents are the next evolution of software automation. You'll learn not only how to build agents today but also how to design extensible, safe, and maintainable systems that evolve with new models and research.

### Hands-On, Project-First Learning

Each phase culminates in a capstone project‚Äîfrom simple ReAct loops to multi-agent orchestrators‚Äîso you graduate with a portfolio of deployable demos and production-grade code.

### Collaborative & Open Source

This course is hosted on GitHub under the `karthikkpro/ai-agent-engineer-course` organization. Contributions, improvements, and new elective modules are welcome!

## What You'll Learn

### Phase 0: Foundations & Mindset

Grasp core agent concepts, autonomy vs. automation, and develop an agentic problem-solving mindset.

### Phase 1: Tools, Prompts & Memory

Master Python integrations, prompt engineering, LangChain wrappers, vector-store memory, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

### Phase 2: Agentic Workflows & Reliability

Implement robust ReAct loops, hybrid RAG pipelines, and systematic evaluation with LangSmith, PromptLayer, and TruLens.

### Phase 3: Multi-Agent Orchestration

Orchestrate planner/executor/reviewer patterns using LangGraph, AutoGen, and CrewAI. Build scalable, secure task networks.

### Phase 4: Production Deployment & Ops

Containerize with Docker, deploy serverless agents, establish CI/CD pipelines, observability (Sentry, Prometheus), and incident runbooks.

### Phase 5: Advanced Safety, RLHF & Continuous Learning

Engineer multi-layer guardrails, run RLHF feedback loops, and build continuous evaluation harnesses with REALM-Bench.

### Phase 6: Portfolio, Leadership & Foresight

Showcase capstones, open-source contributions, leadership frameworks, and a lifelong learning cadence to stay current.
