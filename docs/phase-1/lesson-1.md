# Lesson 1-1: Python for Agents

**Learning Objectives**  
By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:
- Implement tool abstractions as Python functions and registries
- Integrate external APIs using HTTP requests and robust error handling
- Structure agent code using asynchronous (async/await) patterns for performance
- Validate agent tool I/O with Pydantic schemas for strong typing and reliability

---

## 1. Why Python for AI Agents?

Python is the language of choice for agent development due to:
- Mature AI/ML ecosystem (PyTorch, LangChain, Hugging Face, OpenAI SDKs)
- Rapid prototyping for bots, APIs, data pipelines, and orchestration layers
- Widespread libraries for HTTP, async, data validation, and API integration

> **Callout:** Most open-source agent frameworks and LLM APIs (LangChain, CrewAI, FastAPI) use Python as their first-class citizen.

---

## 2. Core Python Primitives for Agents

Agent “tools” are simply Python functions with clear input/output signatures. A common pattern is to store them in a dictionary registry, allowing dynamic lookup and dispatch.

**Example: Tool Abstraction and Registry**
```
def weather_tool(city: str) -> str:
    # Here you'd call a real API (see below)
    return f"Weather for {city} is sunny."

def greet_tool(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

tool_registry = {
    "weather": weather_tool,
    "greet": greet_tool
}

# Dynamic dispatch based on tool name
tool_name = "weather"
result = tool_registry[tool_name]("London")
print(result)  # Output: Weather for London is sunny.
```

**Key Principles:**
- Tools are single-responsibility and reusable
- Exceptions should be handled to avoid agent crashes

**Code Example: Exception Handling**
```
def safe_tool(fn):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        try:
            return fn(*args, **kwargs)
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error: {e}"
    return wrapper

@safe_tool
def fragile_tool(x):
    return 10 / x  # Will error if x == 0
```

---

## 3. HTTP and API Integration

Most practical tools will query external APIs (weather, search, databases). Python’s `requests` library is standard for HTTP, and robust error handling is critical.

**Minimal Weather API Example:**
```
import requests

def weather_tool(city: str) -> str:
    try:
        url = "https://wttr.in/{}?format=3".format(city)
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=3)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Could not get weather: {e}"
```

**Tips:**
- Use `raise_for_status()` to catch HTTP errors
- Always set a `timeout` to avoid agent stalls
- Wrap API calls in try/except blocks for resilience

> **Callout:** All real-world agents interact with some form of remote API or service—error handling isn’t optional!

---

## 4. Asynchronous Programming (AsyncIO)

Agents often perform multiple slow actions (API calls, file reads) in parallel. Asynchronous programming radically speeds up workflows.

**Why async/await?**
- Non-blocking: agent can issue multiple HTTP requests without waiting for each one to finish
- Crucial for data pipelines, multi-tool orchestration, or chat bots that need low-latency responses

**Async Example using httpx (or aiohttp):**
```
import httpx
import asyncio

async def async_weather_tool(city: str) -> str:
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        try:
            r = await client.get(f"https://wttr.in/{city}?format=3", timeout=3.0)
            r.raise_for_status()
            return r.text
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Could not get weather: {e}"

async def main():
    result = await async_weather_tool("London")
    print(result)

# asyncio.run(main())
```

**Diagram Suggestion:**  
_Agent loop with branches for sequential (slow) vs. async (fast, concurrent) API calls.  
Show three tool calls issued in parallel (concurrent lines running to API cloud), converging back to a response funnel._

## 5. Data Validation: Pydantic Schemas

Robust agent systems require strong input and output validation—otherwise, bad data will break the pipeline. Pydantic—used by FastAPI and many AI frameworks—enforces clear schemas.

**Pydantic Example:**
```
from pydantic import BaseModel

class WeatherParams(BaseModel):
    city: str

def weather_tool(params: WeatherParams) -> str:
    # params is now guaranteed to have a city attribute
    return f"Weather for {params.city} is sunny."
```

- Pydantic auto-converts and checks types (e.g., str, int, float)
- Invalid inputs throw clear errors before tool runs

**Integration:**  
- Use Pydantic to define all tool function I/O contracts  
- Combined with FastAPI, you get automatic documentation and validation for any agent-exposed API

---

## 6. Mini-Project: Weather Query Agent

**Goal:**  
Build a CLI script or notebook cell that:
- Accepts a city name from the user
- Queries a weather API using your tool function
- Prints back the weather (handle errors gracefully)

**Steps:**
1. Write a Python function using `requests` to fetch weather info from an API (see above)
2. Wrap the function in a tool registry
3. Add basic error handling and print a user-friendly result
4. (Optionally) Add a Pydantic schema to cleanly parse the city input

**Snippet:**  
```
city = input("Enter city: ")
print(weather_tool(city))
```

## 7. Self-Check Questions

1. Why is using async/await important in agent tool execution?
2. What gap does Pydantic fill for agent systems?
3. How would you handle or log a “tool not found” situation in your registry-based agent code?
4. What is the main advantage of using a tool registry pattern in agent code?
