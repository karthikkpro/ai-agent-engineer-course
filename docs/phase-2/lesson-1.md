# üîÑ Lesson 2-1: Agent Loop Deep Dive

!!! note "Learning Objectives"
    By the end of this lesson, you will able to:

    - Describe each phase of the ReAct loop (Reasoning ‚Üî Acting) in detail
    - Implement dead‚Äêloop and overall timeout guards to prevent infinite cycles
    - Integrate retry, exponential backoff, and fallback strategies into your agent loop
    - Instrument the loop with structured logging and tracing for full observability

## üîç 1. Overview of the ReAct Loop

The **ReAct loop** alternates between **Reasoning** (chain-of-thought planning) and **Acting** (tool invocation or LLM function calls), then captures **Observation** before repeating.

!!! example "ReAct Loop Pseudocode"
    ```python
    while not done and iteration < MAX_ITERATIONS:
        # Reasoning phase
        action, params = planner(memory)
        
        # Acting phase
        result = executor.execute(action, params)
        
        # Observation phase
        memory.append({
            "step": iteration,
            "action": action,
            "params": params,
            "result": result
        })
        
        iteration += 1
    ```

!!! tip "Key Components"
    - **Reasoning**: LLM decides what action to take next
    - **Acting**: Execute the chosen action (tool call, API call, etc.)
    - **Observation**: Capture and store the result
    - **Memory**: Maintain context across iterations

## üõ°Ô∏è 2. Dead-Loop Prevention

### 2.1 Max Iterations Guard

!!! warning "Infinite Loop Risk"
    Agents can get stuck in infinite loops if they don't recognize completion conditions.

!!! example "Max Iterations Implementation"
    ```python
    MAX_ITERATIONS = 10
    
    def agent_loop():
        iteration = 0
        while iteration < MAX_ITERATIONS:
            # ... agent logic ...
            iteration += 1
        
        if iteration >= MAX_ITERATIONS:
            raise MaxIterationsError("Agent exceeded maximum iterations")
    ```

### 2.2 Global Timeout Guard

!!! example "Global Timeout Implementation"
    ```python
    import time
    
    GLOBAL_TIMEOUT = 300  # 5 minutes
    
    def agent_loop():
        start_time = time.time()
        
        while not done:
            if time.time() - start_time > GLOBAL_TIMEOUT:
                raise TimeoutError("Agent loop exceeded total time limit.")
            # per‚Äêaction timer inside executor.execute()
    ```

## üîÑ 3. Retry and Backoff Strategies

### 3.1 Identifying Transient Failures

!!! info "Transient Failure Types"
    - Network errors, rate limits, intermittent API errors

### 3.2 Exponential Backoff

!!! example "Exponential Backoff Implementation"
    ```python
    import random
    import time
    
    def retry_with_backoff(fn, max_retries=3, base_delay=1.0, max_delay=10.0):
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            try:
                return fn()
            except TransientError:
                delay = min(base_delay * 2**attempt, max_delay)
                time.sleep(delay + random.uniform(0, 0.1))
        return fallback()
    ```

### 3.3 Fallback Actions

!!! tip "Fallback Strategy"
    - If retries exhausted, call a safe fallback tool or return a default response
    - Optionally escalate to human-in-loop

---

## üìä 4. Observability & Tracing

### 4.1 Structured Logging

!!! example "Structured Logging Format"
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "iteration": 3,
      "action": "fetch_pricing_docs",
      "params": {"competitor": "CompanyX"},
      "result": "Pricing data retrieved successfully",
      "duration_ms": 345
    }
    ```

### 4.2 Integration with Tracing Dashboards

!!! info "Tracing Integration"
    - Use OpenTelemetry or LangSmith SDK to emit spans for planning, execution, and retrieval
    - Visualize trace graphs showing sequence, timing, and errors

## üíª 5. Mini-Project: Robust ReAct Loop Implementation

!!! success "Robust ReAct Loop Challenge"
    Enhance your Phase 0 calculator agent to include:

    1. **Max Iterations Guard:** stop after `N` steps with a clear message
    2. **Per-Action Timeout:** raise and catch timeouts in executor
    3. **Retry & Backoff:** handle transient errors up to 3 attempts
    4. **Fallback:** if retries fail, return `"Operation failed, please retry later."`
    5. **Logging:** write each iteration's details to `agent_log.json`

!!! example "Starter Skeleton"
    ```python
    import time
    import json
    
    MAX_STEPS = 5
    GLOBAL_TIMEOUT = 60  # seconds
    
    def planner(memory):
        # simple planner stub
        return "calculate", {"expr": "2+2"}
    
    def executor(action, params):
        # implement per-action timeout and raise TransientError if needed
        return str(eval(params["expr"]))
    ```
