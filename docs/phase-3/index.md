# 🤝 Phase 3: Multi-Agent Orchestration

!!! info "Phase Overview"
    Scale beyond single agents to orchestrated multi-agent systems using LangGraph, AutoGen, and CrewAI.

!!! tip "What You'll Learn"
    - **Multi-agent architecture patterns** for complex workflows
    - **LangGraph** for workflow orchestration and state management
    - **AutoGen** collaborative workflows with multiple agents
    - **CrewAI** task networks and agent coordination
    - **Scalable agent communication** and message passing
