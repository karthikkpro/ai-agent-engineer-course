## üèóÔ∏è 1. Multi-Agent Architecture Patterns

### 1.1 Planner/Executor/Reviewer Pattern

!!! example "Three-Agent Pattern"
    ```python
    class PlannerAgent:
        def plan(self, task):
            return {"steps": ["step1", "step2", "step3"]}
    
    class ExecutorAgent:
        def execute(self, plan):
            results = []
            for step in plan["steps"]:
                results.append(self.execute_step(step))
            return results
    
    class ReviewerAgent:
        def review(self, results):
            return {"approved": True, "feedback": "Good work!"}
    ```

!!! tip "Pattern Benefits"
    - **Separation of concerns**: Each agent has a specific role
    - **Modularity**: Easy to swap or upgrade individual agents
    - **Quality control**: Reviewer ensures output quality
    - **Scalability**: Can add more specialized agents

### 1.2 Hierarchical Agent Patterns

!!! info "Hierarchical Structure"
    - **Manager Agent**: Coordinates overall workflow
    - **Specialist Agents**: Handle specific domains (research, writing, analysis)
    - **Worker Agents**: Execute low-level tasks

!!! example "Hierarchical Implementation"
    ```python
    class ManagerAgent:
        def coordinate(self, task):
            # Decompose task
            subtasks = self.decompose(task)
            
            # Assign to specialists
            for subtask in subtasks:
                specialist = self.select_specialist(subtask)
                result = specialist.execute(subtask)
                
            # Synthesize results
            return self.synthesize(results)
    ```

## üîÑ 2. LangGraph for Workflow Orchestration

### 2.1 State Management

!!! info "LangGraph State"
    LangGraph uses a state object to manage data flow between agents.

!!! example "State Definition"
    ```python
    from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
    
    class AgentState(TypedDict):
        messages: Annotated[list, "Chat messages"]
        task: Annotated[str, "Current task"]
        results: Annotated[list, "Execution results"]
        next_agent: Annotated[str, "Next agent to call"]
    ```

### 2.2 Workflow Definition

!!! example "LangGraph Workflow"
    ```python
    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
    
    # Define the workflow
    workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
    
    # Add nodes (agents)
    workflow.add_node("planner", planner_agent)
    workflow.add_node("executor", executor_agent)
    workflow.add_node("reviewer", reviewer_agent)
    
    # Define edges (transitions)
    workflow.add_edge("planner", "executor")
    workflow.add_edge("executor", "reviewer")
    
    # Set entry point
    workflow.set_entry_point("planner")
    
    # Compile the graph
    app = workflow.compile()
    ```

### 2.3 Conditional Routing

!!! example "Conditional Workflow"
    ```python
    def router(state):
        if state["task_type"] == "research":
            return "researcher"
        elif state["task_type"] == "writing":
            return "writer"
        else:
            return "generalist"
    
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "planner",
        router,
        {
            "researcher": "researcher",
            "writer": "writer",
            "generalist": "generalist"
        }
    )
    ```

## ü§ù 3. AutoGen Collaborative Workflows

### 3.1 Agent Definition

!!! example "AutoGen Agent Setup"
    ```python
    from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
    
    # Create agents
    assistant = AssistantAgent(
        name="assistant",
        llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
        system_message="You are a helpful AI assistant."
    )
    
    user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
        name="user_proxy",
        human_input_mode="NEVER",
        max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
        llm_config={"config_list": config_list}
    )
    ```

### 3.2 Multi-Agent Conversations

!!! example "Group Chat Implementation"
    ```python
    from autogen import GroupChat, GroupChatManager
    
    # Create group chat
    groupchat = GroupChat(
        agents=[user_proxy, assistant, coder],
        messages=[],
        max_round=50
    )
    
    manager = GroupChatManager(
        groupchat=groupchat,
        llm_config={"config_list": config_list}
    )
    
    # Start conversation
    user_proxy.initiate_chat(
        manager,
        message="Build a web scraper for news articles"
    )
    ```

### 3.3 Tool Integration

!!! example "Tool-Enabled Agents"
    ```python
    from autogen import AssistantAgent
    
    # Agent with tools
    coder = AssistantAgent(
        name="coder",
        system_message="You are a Python developer. Use tools to write and test code.",
        llm_config={"config_list": config_list}
    )
    
    # Register tools
    coder.register_function(
        function_map={
            "write_code": write_code_function,
            "run_tests": run_tests_function
        }
    )
    ```

## üöÄ 4. CrewAI Task Networks

### 4.1 Crew Definition

!!! example "Crew Setup"
    ```python
    from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
    
    # Define agents
    researcher = Agent(
        role='Research Analyst',
        goal='Find and analyze market data',
        backstory='Expert in market research and data analysis',
        verbose=True,
        allow_delegation=False,
        tools=[search_tool, web_scraper_tool]
    )
    
    writer = Agent(
        role='Content Writer',

        backstory='Experienced content writer and editor',
        verbose=True,
        allow_delegation=False,
        tools=[writing_tool]
    )
    ```

### 4.2 Task Definition

!!! example "Task Creation"
    ```python
    # Define tasks
    research_task = Task(
        description="""
        Research the latest trends in AI and machine learning.
        Focus on practical applications and market opportunities.
        Provide detailed analysis with supporting data.
        """,
        agent=researcher,
        expected_output="Comprehensive research report with data and insights"
    )
    
    writing_task = Task(
        description="""
        Write a blog post based on the research findings.
        Make it engaging and accessible to a general audience.
        Include key insights and actionable takeaways.
        """,

        tasks=[research_task, writing_task],
        verbose=True,
        memory=True
    )
    
    # Execute
    result = crew.kickoff()
    print(result)
    ```

## üîí 5. Security and Scalability

### 5.1 Agent Security

!!! warning "Security Considerations"
    - **Input validation**: Validate all inputs to agents
    - **Output sanitization**: Sanitize agent outputs before use
    - **Access control**: Limit agent permissions and capabilities
    - **Audit logging**: Log all agent interactions for security

!!! example "Security Implementation"
    ```python
    class SecureAgent:
        def __init__(self, permissions):
            self.permissions = permissions
            self.audit_log = []
        
        def execute(self, task):
            # Validate permissions
            if not self.has_permission(task):
                raise PermissionError("Agent lacks permission for this task")
            
            # Log execution
            self.audit_log.append({
                "timestamp": time.time(),
                "task": task,
                "agent": self.name
            })
            
            # Execute with sandboxing
            return self.sandboxed_execute(task)
    ```

### 5.2 Scalability Patterns

!!! info "Scaling Strategies"
    - **Horizontal scaling**: Add more agent instances
    - **Load balancing**: Distribute tasks across agents
    - **Caching**: Cache common results and responses
    - **Async processing**: Use async/await for non-blocking operations

!!! example "Scalable Architecture"
    ```python
    import asyncio
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
    
    class ScalableAgentSystem:
        def __init__(self, max_workers=10):
            self.executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers)
            self.agent_pool = []
        
        async def execute_task(self, task):
            # Get available agent
            agent = await self.get_available_agent()
            
            # Execute in thread pool
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            result = await loop.run_in_executor(
                self.executor, 
                agent.execute, 
                task
            )
            
            return result
    ```

## üíª 6. Mini-Project: Multi-Agent Content Creation System

!!! success "Content Creation Challenge"
    **Build a multi-agent system that creates content:**

    1. **Researcher Agent**: Gathers information on a topic
    2. **Writer Agent**: Creates initial content
    3. **Editor Agent**: Reviews and improves content
    4. **Publisher Agent**: Formats and publishes content

!!! example "Implementation Skeleton"
    ```python
    from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
    
    # Define agents
    researcher = Agent(
        role='Research Specialist',
        goal='Gather comprehensive information on topics',
        tools=[web_search_tool, document_reader_tool]
    )
    
    writer = Agent(
        role='Content Writer',
        goal='Create engaging and informative content',
        tools=[writing_tool, grammar_checker_tool]
    )
    
    editor = Agent(
        role='Content Editor',
        goal='Review and improve content quality',
        tools=[editing_tool, fact_checker_tool]
    )
    
    # Define workflow
    research_task = Task(description="Research the topic", agent=researcher)
    writing_task = Task(description="Write content", agent=writer)
    editing_task = Task(description="Edit and improve", agent=editor)
    
    # Create and execute crew
    crew = Crew(agents=[researcher, writer, editor], 
                tasks=[research_task, writing_task, editing_task])
    result = crew.kickoff()
    ```
